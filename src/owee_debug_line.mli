(** [read_chunk cursor ~pointers_to_other_sections] expects the [cursor] to be
    pointing to the beginning of a DWARF linenumber program. Those are usually
    put in ".debug_line" section of an ELF binary.

    Iff such a program is found, the [cursor] is advanced to the next one (or
    to the end) and [Some (header, cursor')] is returned.

    [pointers_to_other_sections] are needed in DWARF 5 because filenames can be
    pointers to strings in entirely separate sections of DWARF. You can use
    {! Owee_elf.debug_line_pointers} to construct such a value. *)

    registry in the [state.file] field.  This function reads this registry if
    [state.file] is valid, or returns [state.filename]. *)
